                <p>TESTIMONIAL</p>
                <h2>Jon Heaume</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="first-content">
                <p>The project was to demolish and rebuild from the ground up - but it was complex. The site is on three levels, 
                    an end of terrace, with the middle level below ground on two sides and the lower level below ground on three sides. 
                    The lower level required excavation and the entire structure is supported by 4 pairs of 16m deep piles each pair with 
                    a rock anchor of 25m. The street has a two ton weight restriction, just to make matters worse - yes, it is The Strand, in St Peter Port. </p>

                    <p>I didn't know Mick before Just Build It came on site and although I knew we would be facing some 
                        challenges I was not aware of just how many there would be. 
                        The view, I told myself, compensates for everything. </p>

                <div class="first-content">
                    <p>Mick is not just a builder. He is a master of his craft. He project manages, he thinks, he engages and immerses himself in whatever issues arise. Mick communicates ...
                        with everybody. The client, architects, engineers, sub contractors, suppliers, tradesmen, labourers, planners, building control ... and he makes things happen. </p>
                        <p>Mick takes problems in his stride. We had massive engineering issues; propping up the road and the neighbouring house - three levels down from the top; tanking - and not
                            just any old tanking. Ours was an exceptionally complex damp proofing challenge and Mick took the greatest care and paid attention to the finest details, insisting on doing
                            the bulk of the critical work himself. We had to excavate 350 tons of soil by hand - move it 200 yards down the road to skips in Havelet. We had to bring all materials in via
                            the same route; concrete deliveries unloading 1 ton at a time; the list goes on and on - and not just the heavy ground works but all the way to the fine finishes. Nothing was
                            ever a problem and Mick's cheerful demeanour kept the whole site buzzing. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="first-content">
                    <p>We did a course together in laying epoxy resin flooring, and then laid two floors. Mick came up with the ideas; he studied micro-cement and laid the lower floor in this superb
                        material; wet rooms were carefully and painstakingly constructed by Mick, to ensure we never have leaks; there are so many intricate things, that take a caring and knowledgeable
                        person to manage - like ensuring that the free standing bath is so perfectly level that the first time you fill it with water to test it out it fills right to the top and yes, it
                        overflows perfectly around the entire rim all at precisely the same moment. That doesn't happen by accident! </p>
                        <p>As well as a great builder, Mick's people skills were in demand at our restrictive site in the Strand. No parking for anything anywhere, and the one ton dumper trundling up
                            and down the road constantly for a year or more; vans here there and everywhere loading and unloading tools etc; scaffolding; road closures, as infrequently as possible,
                            but inevitable ... and Mick's considerate handling of our neighbours in The Strand meant that everything went smoothly - and the project took nearly eighteen months from
                            the start of the demolition to that wonderful moment when the keys are handed over. Mick was there all through from beginning to end - no nipping off to other sites and not
                            being seen again for two days like so many builders I have known. </p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="first-content">
                    <p>In short, Mick is passionate about what he does, and he does it brilliantly ... from start ... to finish ... and beyond, because he is always there for us, long after the end of the
                        project. Oh, and let's not forget the business end of things. Totally transparent. Mick kept me posted at all stages. There were no surprises in a project that itself was full of twists
                        and turns along the way. Mick would often suggest small changes, and sometimes not so small, because he could see better ways of doing things. Never any "extras" on the bill - just good
                        common sense, practical application of building skills. </p>

                <p>I was recommended by a friend to choose Just Build it to extend my home at ground and first floor levels.

                    I took the advice…
                    
                      </p>

                      <p>It was an awkward project as we decided to live in while the work was undertaken.  

                        Mick and his team were superb, Communication, integrity and workmanship all top class.
                        
                        Built, knocked through and finished inside of 12 months with very little hassle along the way. </p>

                        <p>If I had to do it all again?

                            I wouldn’t waste my time looking elsewhere, I’d just call Mick. </p>
